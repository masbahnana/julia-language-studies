# With OSX I have had some problems using the Pango as part of the Winston package
# to display titles and text etc.
#
# This seems to be a problem with Homebrew and the following worked for me
# It only needs to be run once,
# 
# using Homebrew 
# Homebrew.update() 
# Homebrew.rm("pango")
# Homebrew.add("pango")
